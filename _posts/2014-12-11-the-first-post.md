As I have only recently discovered, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a free, open-source way to build static websites. It is fairly intuitive to use, and it really does make simple, nice-looking websites. I have been playing around with a very basic, "default" Jekyll site and have tailored it to create my own site, which I am thus far quite pleased with. If you'd like to learn more about Jekyll, you can check out its [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_%28software%29) or its original [announcement](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) from its creator, Tom Preston-Werner.

Jekyll has built-in mechanisms to make blogging simple and easy. I hadn't intended to keep a blog, but I think I could re-purpose this functionality to occasionally post thoughts I have related to my work, projects I am considering, or other ideas that are on my mind. 

As a graduate student, it is unlikely that I will have much time to share well-formed thoughts (let alone actaully have any) in the form of new posts. But maybe having this website in addition to the ability to easily share new content might be motivation for me. 

We'll see about that. Until next time!
