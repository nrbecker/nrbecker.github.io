On more than one occasion, family members, friends, or people I meet outside of the field have posed some variation of one or all of the following questions to me:

* What is cognitive science? 
* Why are you studying it? 
* What are you going to do with your life?

All are legitimate questions, as cognitive science is a relatively new field that concerns itself with a very broad range disciplines, including computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology. A quick skim over the [Wikipedia article on cognitive science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) will speak more precisely to its breadth. As a result, telling someone I study cognitive science honestly doesn't say much about *what* I do, *why* I chose to pursue it, or *what* I plan to do with an advanced degree in cognitive science.

Broadly speaking, cognitive science is the study of the mind/brain and how it processes, stores, and retrieves information. This means that cognitive scientists might study visual perception, language acquisition or processing, memory, or computational approaches to modeling what the brain can do with regard to any of these areas. There are many other possibilities; as Paul once told me, cognitive science goes anywhere the mind goes. My own work spans language and computational modeling. With a background in computer science and linguistics, my research currently has me investigating new ways to model language processing as a computational system. This will be the focus of my first project. As I progress in my academic career, I'm sure my research interests will shift around as I learn more about this interesting field.

So why did I choose to this stuff? In many ways, it wasn't a conscious decision; rather, it's where my long-standing interests in language, math, computers, and the brain led me. After studying computer science and linguistics as an undergraduate, I wanted to enroll in a graduate program in which I could keep doing some of the things that both linguists and computer scientists do, but with a focus on applying those methodologies to the study the brain. Studying cognitive science at Hopkins lets me do exactly that. And I don't have to pigeonhole myself as a "linguist" or a "computer scientist." At Hopkins, I have a great deal of freedom with regard to exploring my interests and both fine-tuning and applying my technical skills.

Finally: just what am I going to do with an advanced degree in cognitive science? The truth is that I'm not sure yet. If someone had told me as a freshman in college that I would be enrolling in a cognitive science PhD program at Johns Hopkins upon graduation, I would have been both shocked and amused. But this is where my interests and decisions over the last several years have taken me. I think the same will be able to be said of my pursuits after graduate school. For a long time, I have seen myself as a future educator and researcher at the university level, yet I also have an interest in more applied settings like software research and/or development. I'm being vague, but it is my belief that cognitive science is such a broad field that I will be qualified for many positions once I receive my graduate degree. For now, my plan is to wait and see what opportunities arise in the coming years.
