As I have only recently discovered, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a free, open-source way to build static websites. It seems fairly intuitive to use, and it really does make nice-looking websites. I have been playing around with a very basic, "default" Jekyll site and have tailored it to create my own site, which I am pleased with. 

It turns out that Jekyll has built-in mechanisms to make blogging easy. I hadn't intended to keep a blog, but I think I could re-purpose that functionality to occasionally post thoughts I have related to my work, projects I am considering, or simply interesting thoughts that are on my mind. 

Of course, as a graduate student, it is unlikely that I will ever really have time to share well-formed thoughts (let alone actaully have any) in the form of new posts. But perhaps simply having a personal website in addition to the easy ability to share new content might be a motivator for me. 

We'll see about that. Until next time!
