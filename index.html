  <strong>Hi!</strong>

  <p>I am a first-year graduate student in the <a href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/">Department of Cognitive Science</a> at Johns Hopkins University. My advisors are <a href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/people/smolensky.html">Paul Smolensky</a> and <a href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/people/legendre.html">G&eacuteraldine Legendre</a>.</p>

  <p>I finished my undergraduate degree in computer science and linguistics at <a href="http://www.truman.edu">Truman State University</a> in the spring of 2014 and began the PhD program at Hopkins the following fall.</p>

  <strong>Research Interests</strong>
  <p>My research interests are broad, but mostly center around computational cogntive science and linguistics, theoretical linguistics, and language acquisition.</p>

  <p>I am currently working closely with Paul Smolensky and others on the gradient symbolic computation project, looking for ways to integrate discrete (symbolic) and continuous (connectionist) models of cognition. More specifically, we are investigating a new model of language processing that permits "blended" mental states during processing.</p>

  <strong>For more information about cognitive science, why I'm studying it, or what I plan to do with it, see <a href="uncategorized/2015/01/11/on-cognitive-science.html">this thought post</a>.</strong>
