  <h1 class="post-title">welcome</h1>
  <p>Greetings! I am a second-year graduate student in the <a href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/">Department of Cognitive Science</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>. My advisors are <a href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/paul-smolensky/">Paul Smolensky</a> and <a href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/geraldine-legendre/">G&eacuteraldine Legendre</a>.</p>

  <p>I finished my undergraduate degree in computer science and linguistics at <a href="http://www.truman.edu">Truman State University</a> in the spring of 2014 and began the PhD program at Hopkins the following fall.</p>

  <h1 class="post-title">research</h1>
  <p>The brain a very peculiar type of computer. Not a "computer" in the usual sense, with isolated components for memory, storage, and processing, but rather in the general sense of "something that computes." Human behavior, including language, is the result of some kind of computation that takes place in the brain.</p>

  <p>My primary research interest is in characterizing these computations and exploring precisely how they can result in complex behavior like language production and comprehension. Naturally, this has led me to connectionism, an approach to modeling cognitive phenomena using artificial neural networks. Additionally, I am interested in topics like learning and language acquisition, as well as more application-oriented domains like natural language processing.</p>

  <p>I am currently working closely with Paul Smolensky, <a href="http://pwcho.weebly.com/">Pyeong Whan Cho</a>, and many others on the "Gradient Symbolic Computation" (GSC) project, the focus of which is on integrating discrete (symbolic) and continuous (connectionist) models of computation. A natural consequence of our approach is <i>blended representations</i>, which prove to be a valuable contribution to models of both language production and language comprehension. My first project deals with the former: using GSC to model speech production errors during tongue-twister tasks. This work is very much ongoing, so stay tuned for updates!</p>
