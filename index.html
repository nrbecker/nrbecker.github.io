  <strong>Hi!</strong>

  <p>I am a first-year graduate student in the Department of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University. My advisors are <a class="one" href="http://mind.cog.jhu.edu/faculty/smolensky/Site/homepage.htm">Paul Smolensky</a> and <a class="one" href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/people/legendre.html">G&eacuteraldine Legendre</a>.</p>

  <p>I finished my undergraduate degree in computer science and linguistics at <a class="one" href="http://www.truman.edu">Truman State University</a> in spring of 2014 and began the PhD program at Hopkins the following fall.</p>

  <strong>Research Interests</strong>
  <p>My research interests are broad, but mostly center around computational cogntive science and linguistics, theoretical linguistics, and language acquisition.</p>

  <p>I am currently working closely with Paul Smolensky and others on the gradient symbolic computation project, looking for ways to integrate discrete (symbolic) and continuous (connectionist) models of cognition.</p>
