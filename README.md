==================

This is the academic website of Nicholas Becker, a PhD student in Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University. 

This site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and was developed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

Work on this site is intermittent but ongoing. Its design is simply a customized version of the basic Jekyll layout (no pre-created theme).
